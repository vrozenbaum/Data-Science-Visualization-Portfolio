### Projects
#### US Exonerations 1989-2017
For my capstone project at General Assemblyâ€™s Data Science Immersion Program, I chose to work with the National Registry of Exonerations Database. The projected was heavily focused on exploratory data analaysis and inference. I was interested in looking at exoneration trends over the years as well as racial disparities in the data. I conducted Bayesian Inference to test whether post 1994 black and white murder exonerees were statistically different. The modeling portion consisted of building a panel regression which predicted exonerations per state for 2017. Overall, my model had an adjusted R2 of .71, meaning that 71% of the variance in the data was accounted for.

#### Web Scraping Indeed.com & Predicting Data Science Salaries
This projected consisted of building a webscraper that would scrape individual portions of Data Science job listings from Indeed.com.
